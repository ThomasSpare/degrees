# 3 Degrees Actor to Actor
---

This is my first assignment project with SC50 harvard University - Introduction to AI with Python<br>
The Task is to find how many steps there are between two actors in relation to movies they appeared together in.<br>
Take for instance Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon. Well they appeared both in the Appollo 18 movie, so this equals to 1 step.<br>
This is done by implementing an AI Search method to count how many steps it is from a source movie actor<br>
to a target actor.
