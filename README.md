This is my first assignment project with SC50 harvard University - Introduction to AI with Python<br>
According to the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game, anyone in the Hollywood film industry can be connected<br> 
to Kevin Bacon within six steps, where each step consists of finding a film that two actors both starred in.
In this problem, we’re interested in finding the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence<br>
of movies that connects them. For example, the shortest path between Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Hanks is 2: Jennifer Lawrence <br>
is connected to Kevin Bacon by both starring in “X-Men: First Class,” and Kevin Bacon is connected to Tom Hanks by both starring in “Apollo 13.”
This is done by implementing an AI Search method to count how many steps it is from a source movie actor<br>
to a target actor.
